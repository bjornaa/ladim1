LADiM configuration
===================

The LADiM model system is highly configurable using a separate configuration file. The goal is that a user should not have to touch the code, every
necessary aspect should be customizable by the configuration file.

The name of the configuration file is given as a command line argument to the
main ladim script. If the name is missing, a default name of :file:`ladim1.yaml`
is supposed.

It is a goal to provide sane defaults in the configuration file, so that
enhancements of the configuration setup do not break existing configuration
files.

The configuration file format is a subset of `yaml (YAML Ain't Markup
Language) <http:yaml.org>`_. Knowledge of ``yaml`` is not necessary. The
example configuration files are self-describing and can easily be modified.

.. note::

  The indentation in a yaml file is mandatory, it is part of the syntax. In
  particular note that the indentation has to be done by **spaces**, **not tabs**.
  Reasonable editors will recognize yaml-files by the extension and will
  automatically produce spaces when you hit the tab key.

An example configuration file

Below is an example configuration file, :file:`models/salmon_lice/ladim1.yaml`.
