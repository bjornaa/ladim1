Running LADiM
=============

Trying LADiM
------------

With LADiM installed, it is time to test it out.

Go to the examples directory, first :file:`examples/data` and
download an example data file :file:`ocean_avg_0014.nc` by the command::

  python download.py

Change to one of the other example directories, for instance :file:`examples/line` and run::

  python make_release.py
  ladim

Look at the results by::

  python animate.py

.. Note::
   Depending on your python installation you may have to substitute :program:`python3` for :program:`python` in the examples above.

After browsing through the configuration and particle release chapters below,
you can copy the example directory anywhere and modify with other release
scenarios or perhaps a ROMS' history or average file of your own.

The main ladim script
---------------------

Installing LADiM puts the main :program:`ladim` script on the PATH. It provides the command::

  ladim [-h] [-d] [-s] [config_file]

.. program:: ladim

The options are:

.. option:: -h, --help

   Show a help message and exit

.. option:: -d, --debug

   Show more logging information

.. option:: -s, --silent

   Show less logging information

.. option:: config_file

   Name of optional configuration file, default = :file:`ladim1.yaml`

Running LADiM from python
-------------------------

LADiM can be run inside a python program. This is done by::

  import ladim
  #  ... more lines ...
  with open('ladim1.yaml') as fid:
      ladim1.main(config_stream=fid)

The main LADiM script, :file:`scripts/ladim`, uses this approach. The
:file:`jupyter` example shows how to use this with a triple quoted text string
for the configuration, using the standard module :mod:`StringIO`.
